       "Auto-regressive large language models (LLMs) represent a significant advancement in artificial intelligence, primarily due to their ability to predict and generate sequences of text in a manner that closely mimics human writing. At their core, these models function by learning the probability distribution of words or sub-word units (tokens) based on the context of preceding tokens in a given sequence. This means that, given a prompt or an initial set of words, the model predicts the next most likely token, appends it to the sequence, and then iteratively repeats this process to generate coherent and contextually relevant text. This sequential approach allows auto-regressive LLMs to produce diverse outputs, including articles, stories, code, and even translations, making them versatile tools for a wide range of applications.\n",
       "\n",
       "The power of auto-regressive LLMs lies in their ability to learn complex relationships and patterns from massive datasets of text and code. Through exposure to billions of words, these models develop a deep understanding of grammar, syntax, semantics, and even stylistic nuances. This extensive training allows them to generate text that is not only grammatically correct but also exhibits a remarkable degree of coherence and understanding. Furthermore, techniques like attention mechanisms enable the model to focus on the most relevant parts of the input sequence, improving its ability to capture long-range dependencies and maintain context throughout longer generations.\n",
       "\n",
       "However, despite their impressive capabilities, auto-regressive LLMs are not without their limitations. They can sometimes exhibit biases present in their training data, leading to outputs that are discriminatory or reinforce harmful stereotypes. Additionally, they can sometimes generate factually incorrect or nonsensical information, particularly when dealing with topics outside their core knowledge base. Addressing these challenges requires ongoing research and development in areas such as bias mitigation, fact verification, and the development of more robust and reliable evaluation metrics. Nevertheless, auto-regressive LLMs represent a powerful tool with the potential to revolutionize how we interact with and generate text, making them a vital area of focus in the field of AI.\n"

The LangGraph code was adapted from the awesome DeepLearning.AI course on [AI Agents in LangGraph](https://www.deeplearning.ai/short-courses/ai-agents-in-langgraph/).\n",
    "\n",
    "By defining a structured state flow with nodes such as \"Planner,\" \"Research Plan,\" \"Generate,\" \"Reflect,\" and \"Research Critique,\" the system iteratively creates an essay on a given topic, incorporates feedback, and provides research-backed insights.\n",

       "\n",
       "**Introduction**\n",
       "\n",
       "The 2024 T20 World Cup, co-hosted by the West Indies and the USA, was a spectacle of thrilling cricket, marked by unexpected upsets and record-breaking performances. From the USA's stunning victory over Pakistan to Afghanistan's dominant performance against New Zealand, the tournament delivered memorable moments that resonated far beyond the cricket pitch. Featuring 20 teams vying for the coveted title, the event not only showcased intense competition but also highlighted the growing global appeal of T20 cricket. This essay argues that the 2024 T20 World Cup, characterized by its unpredictable outcomes and captivating narratives, significantly impacted the global popularity of cricket, fostered the development of emerging cricketing nations, and spurred the evolution of T20 strategy.\n",
       "\n",
       "**Tournament Results and Key Outcomes**\n",
       "\n",
       "India emerged as the champions of the 2024 T20 World Cup, defeating South Africa in a closely contested final held in Bridgetown. India's victory was built on a combination of strong batting performances and disciplined bowling, solidifying their status as a dominant force in T20 cricket. Key statistics from the tournament include Virat Kohli finishing as the highest run-scorer with 350 runs, and Jasprit Bumrah leading the wicket charts with 25 wickets. Beyond the usual suspects, the tournament saw impressive performances from emerging teams like the USA and Uganda, with Uganda securing a notable win against Papua New Guinea.

       "The 2024 T20 World Cup witnessed unprecedented levels of viewership and engagement, with record numbers of fans tuning in via television, streaming platforms, and social media. The tournament's co-hosting by the USA played a crucial role in expanding cricket's reach in North America, attracting new audiences and generating substantial interest in the sport. This surge in popularity is expected to have a lasting impact on the ICC's revenue and sponsorship opportunities, paving the way for further investment in cricket development programs worldwide. Moreover, the tournament highlighted the emergence of new talent and the evolution of T20 strategies, influencing player valuations in domestic T20 leagues and prompting discussions on innovative coaching and training methods. The 2024 T20 World Cup has left an indelible mark on the landscape of cricket, promising a future of continued growth and excitement."

       "Okay, here's a critique of your first draft. It's a good start, but we can definitely elevate it to a more compelling and insightful essay.\n",
       "\n",
       "**Overall Impression:**\n",
       "\n",
       "The essay provides a decent overview of the 2024 T20 World Cup, highlighting key events and potential impacts. However, it currently reads more like a summary or report than a persuasive essay with a strong argument. The analysis is somewhat superficial, and the writing lacks vividness and depth.\n",
       "\n",
       "**Specific Areas for Improvement:**\n",
       "\n",
       "*   **Thesis Statement:** While the introduction presents a thesis, it's a bit broad. It needs to be more specific about *how* the tournament impacted global popularity, fostered development, and spurred strategic evolution. What *specific* aspects of the tournament led to these outcomes?\n",
       "*   **Depth of Analysis:** The essay skims the surface of several important points. For example, the USA's victory over Pakistan is mentioned, but the essay doesn't delve into *why* this was such a significant upset, what factors contributed to it, or what its specific impact was. Similarly, the struggles of Pakistan and New Zealand are noted, but without detailed explanation.\n",
       "*   **Evidence and Support:** The essay mentions statistics (Kohli's runs, Bumrah's wickets), but it needs more concrete evidence to support its claims. For example, when discussing increased viewership, provide specific viewership numbers or percentage increases. When discussing the impact on T20 strategies, cite examples of specific strategic shifts observed during or after the tournament.\n",
       "*   **Structure and Flow:** The essay is logically organized, but the transitions between paragraphs could be smoother. Each paragraph should clearly build upon the previous one and contribute to the overall argument.\n",
       "*   **Style and Tone:** The writing is somewhat bland and lacks a distinctive voice. Try to use more vivid language and vary your sentence structure to make the essay more engaging. Avoid clichés like \"indelible mark.\"\n",
       "*   **Counterarguments and Nuance:** Acknowledge potential counterarguments or alternative perspectives. For example, did the tournament have any negative impacts? Were there any criticisms of the format, scheduling, or officiating?\n",
       "*   **Conclusion:** The conclusion is a bit generic. It should summarize the main points of the essay and leave the reader with a lasting impression. Consider ending with a thought-provoking statement or a prediction about the future of T20 cricket.\n",
       "\n",
       "**Detailed Recommendations:**\n",
       "\n",
       "1.  **Refine the Thesis Statement (Introduction):**\n",
       "    *   **Length:** Keep it concise (1-2 sentences), but pack it with specific information.\n",
       "    *   **Depth:** Instead of just saying the tournament \"impacted global popularity,\" specify *how*. Did it lead to increased participation in youth cricket programs? Did it attract new sponsors? Did it generate more media coverage?\n",
       "    *   **Example:** \"The 2024 T20 World Cup, highlighted by the USA's shocking victory over Pakistan and Afghanistan's strategic bowling prowess, significantly boosted cricket's global appeal by attracting a new North American audience, fostered the development of emerging nations through increased ICC funding tied to tournament performance, and spurred the evolution of T20 strategy with the rise of spin-heavy bowling attacks and more aggressive powerplay batting.\"\n",
       "2.  **Expand on Key Outcomes (Tournament Results and Key Outcomes):**\n",
       "    *   **Length:** This section should be significantly longer and more detailed.\n",
       "    *   **Depth:**\n",
       "        *   **USA vs. Pakistan:** Analyze the specific factors that led to the USA's victory (e.g., Pakistan's poor batting form, USA's strong bowling performance, home-field advantage). Discuss the impact of this win on cricket in the USA (e.g., increased media coverage, surge in ticket sales for future matches).\n",
       "        *   **Afghanistan's Performance:** Explain *how* Afghanistan dominated New Zealand. Was it their spin bowling? Their aggressive batting? What specific strategies did they employ?\n",
       "        *   **Pakistan and New Zealand's Struggles:** Don't just say they struggled. Analyze *why*. Were their strategies outdated? Did they lack key players? Were they unprepared for the conditions?\n",
       "        *   **Uganda's Win:** Provide context. Who is Papua New Guinea? Why was this win significant for Uganda?\n",
       "    *   **Evidence:** Include specific examples of player performances, strategic decisions, and match statistics to support your analysis.\n",
       "3.  **Provide Concrete Evidence (Impact on Global Cricket and Beyond):**\n",
       "    *   **Length:** This section should also be expanded.\n",
       "    *   **Depth:**\n",
       "        *   **Viewership and Engagement:** Provide specific viewership numbers (e.g., \"The final match between India and South Africa drew an average of 500 million viewers worldwide, a 20% increase from the 2022 final\"). Cite sources for these numbers.\n",
       "        *   **Impact in the USA:** Provide evidence of increased interest in cricket in the USA (e.g., \"Ticket sales for the upcoming USA vs. India series have increased by 500% since the World Cup\").\n",
       "        *   **ICC Revenue and Sponsorship:** Explain *how* the tournament is expected to impact ICC revenue. Are there any new sponsorship deals in the works?\n",
       "        *   **Evolution of T20 Strategies:** Cite specific examples of strategic shifts observed during or after the tournament (e.g., \"Several teams adopted a spin-heavy bowling attack in the middle overs, a strategy that proved particularly effective on the slow pitches of the West Indies\").\n",
       "        *   **Player Valuations:** Provide examples of players whose valuations have increased due to their performance in the World Cup.\n",
       "    *   **Style:** Use strong verbs and descriptive language to make your writing more engaging.\n",
       "4.  **Strengthen the Conclusion:**\n",
       "    *   **Length:** A slightly longer conclusion (4-5 sentences) would be beneficial.\n",
       "    *   **Depth:** Summarize the main points of your essay in a concise and compelling way. End with a thought-provoking statement or a prediction about the future of T20 cricket.\n",
       "    *   **Example:** \"The 2024 T20 World Cup was more than just a cricket tournament; it was a catalyst for global growth, a platform for emerging nations, and a laboratory for strategic innovation. As cricket continues its expansion into new markets and evolves at an ever-increasing pace, the lessons learned from this tournament will undoubtedly shape the future of the sport for years to come. The rise of associate nations may even lead to a re-evaluation of the test-match landscape.\"\n",
       "5.  **Consider Adding a Section on Controversies/Criticisms (Optional):**\n",
       "    *   Did the tournament face any criticism regarding scheduling, officiating, or the format itself? Addressing these issues would add nuance to your analysis.\n",
       "\n",
       "**In summary, focus on adding depth, providing concrete evidence, and refining your thesis statement. Make sure each paragraph contributes directly to your overall argument and that your writing is clear, concise, and engaging.**\n",
       "\n",
       "I'm ready for your next draft! Good luck!"

       "\n",
       "**I. Introduction**\n",
       "The 2024 T20 World Cup, co-hosted by the West Indies and the United States, culminated in a thrilling final where India defeated South Africa by 7 runs. This tournament, the ninth edition of the ICC Men's T20 World Cup, showcased not only intense competition but also the burgeoning global reach of cricket. Featuring 20 teams and 55 matches across nine venues, the event was marked by record-breaking performances, unexpected upsets, and significant milestones. The USA's participation and co-hosting role underscored cricket's expanding footprint, setting the stage for a tournament that would leave a lasting impact on the sport's popularity, player development, and strategic evolution.\n",
       "\n",
       "**II. Tournament Results and Key Performances**\n",
       "India emerged victorious, but the tournament was defined by more than just the final result. Several players achieved remarkable feats, including Fazalhaq Farooqi and Arshdeep Singh, who set new records for the most wickets in a single edition. Pat Cummins distinguished himself by taking two consecutive hat-tricks, a feat unmatched in T20 World Cup history. Afghanistan's surprising victory over Australia highlighted the growing competitiveness of emerging cricket nations. The West Indies posted the highest team total of the tournament, scoring 218/5 against Afghanistan, demonstrating the potential for explosive batting performances. These moments underscored the unpredictable nature of T20 cricket and the rising talent from diverse cricketing backgrounds.\n",
       "\n",
       "**III. Lasting Impact on Cricket's Landscape**\n",
       "The 2024 T20 World Cup has had a multifaceted impact on the global cricket landscape. The tournament is estimated to be responsible for a significant increase in tourist arrivals in host nations like Barbados, demonstrating its economic impact. Initiatives like the \"Playground to Podium\" program in the USA aim to capitalize on the tournament's momentum to promote cricket at the grassroots level. Furthermore, the event has spurred discussions on the influence of pitches on T20 strategy and player adaptability, prompting teams to innovate their approaches to the game. The 2024 T20 World Cup not only delivered thrilling cricket but also laid the foundation for sustained growth and evolution of the sport worldwide."

       "Okay, here's my critique of your 3-paragraph essay. Overall, it's a good start, providing a concise overview of the 2024 T20 World Cup. However, it could benefit from more depth, specific examples, and a more engaging writing style.\n",
       "\n",
       "**Overall Feedback:**\n",
       "\n",
       "*   **Length:** The essay is quite short. Each paragraph could be expanded to provide more detail and analysis. Aim for at least 5-7 sentences per paragraph.\n",
       "*   **Depth:** While you touch on key aspects, the essay lacks in-depth analysis. You state facts but don't always explore their significance or implications.\n",
       "*   **Specificity:** The essay would be stronger with more specific examples and data to support your claims.\n",
       "*   **Engagement:** The writing style is somewhat dry. Incorporating more vivid language and a stronger narrative voice would make the essay more engaging.\n",
       "\n",
       "**Paragraph-by-Paragraph Breakdown and Recommendations:**\n",
       "\n",
       "**I. Introduction:**\n",
       "\n",
       "*   **Critique:** The introduction is a good starting point, but it's a bit too general. The claim that India defeated South Africa by 7 runs is incorrect, as India did not play South Africa in the final. This undermines the credibility of the essay from the outset.\n",
       "*   **Recommendations:**\n",
       "    *   **Correct the factual error:** Ensure all information is accurate. Research the actual final match and result.\n",
       "    *   **Expand on the \"burgeoning global reach\":** Provide a specific example of how the USA's involvement demonstrates this reach. Mention the number of viewers, media coverage, or fan engagement in the US.\n",
       "    *   **Strengthen the thesis statement:** The last sentence is a good start, but make it more assertive and specific. What *lasting* impact are you referring to? Tease the key arguments you'll make in the body paragraphs.\n",
       "    *   **Add context:** Briefly mention the history of the T20 World Cup and its significance in the world of cricket.\n",
       "\n",
       "**II. Tournament Results and Key Performances:**\n",
       "\n",
       "*   **Critique:** This paragraph provides some interesting highlights, but it feels like a list of facts rather than a cohesive analysis.\n",
       "*   **Recommendations:**\n",
       "    *   **Provide context for the records:** Why were Farooqi and Singh's wicket records significant? How did Cummins' hat-tricks impact the matches?\n",
       "    *   **Elaborate on Afghanistan's victory:** What made this victory so surprising? Who did they beat, and what was the context of the match? What was the impact of this victory on the tournament standings and morale?\n",
       "    *   **Analyze the West Indies' high score:** What factors contributed to this high score? How did it reflect on their overall performance in the tournament?\n",
       "    *   **Focus on a narrative:** Instead of just listing achievements, weave them into a narrative that highlights the key themes of the tournament (e.g., the rise of emerging nations, the dominance of certain players, the unpredictable nature of T20 cricket).\n",
       "    *   **Add more examples:** Include 1-2 more examples of key performances or surprising results.\n",
       "\n",
       "**III. Lasting Impact on Cricket's Landscape:**\n",
       "\n",
       "*   **Critique:** This paragraph touches on important aspects of the tournament's impact, but it needs more development and specific evidence.\n",
       "*   **Recommendations:**\n",
       "    *   **Quantify the economic impact:** Instead of saying \"significant increase,\" provide specific data on tourist arrivals and revenue generated. Cite a source if possible.\n",
       "    *   **Elaborate on the \"Playground to Podium\" program:** What are the specific goals of this program? How is it being implemented? What are the expected outcomes?\n",
       "    *   **Explain the discussion on pitches:** What specific issues were raised about the pitches? How did they affect the strategies of different teams? Provide examples of teams adapting their approaches.\n",
       "    *   **Expand on the \"sustained growth and evolution\":** What specific changes or developments do you anticipate as a result of the tournament?\n",
       "    *   **Concluding sentence:** The final sentence is a bit generic. End with a more impactful statement that summarizes the overall significance of the 2024 T20 World Cup.\n",
       "\n",
       "**Additional Recommendations:**\n",
       "\n",
       "*   **Research:** Conduct thorough research to ensure accuracy and to gather specific data and examples.\n",
       "*   **Structure:** Consider using topic sentences at the beginning of each paragraph to clearly state the main point.\n",
       "*   **Transitions:** Use transition words and phrases to create a smoother flow between paragraphs and sentences.\n",
       "*   **Proofread:** Carefully proofread your essay for grammar, spelling, and punctuation errors.\n",
       "\n",
       "By addressing these points, you can significantly improve the depth, clarity, and impact of your essay. Good luck!"

       "\n",
       "The 2024 T20 World Cup culminated in a thrilling final where India defeated South Africa by 7 runs, showcasing the high stakes and competitive spirit that defined the tournament. India's victory was underpinned by stellar performances, including leading run-scorer Virat Kohli. Several matches stood out, including the USA tying with Pakistan and winning in the super over, and Afghanistan's stunning 21-run victory over Australia, highlighting the growing competitiveness of emerging cricket nations. These upsets, combined with nail-biting finishes, underscored the unpredictable nature of T20 cricket and captivated audiences worldwide.\n",
       "\n",
       "**II. Global Reach and Economic Impact**\n",
       "\n",
       "The tournament's co-hosting by the West Indies and the United States marked a significant step in cricket's global expansion. The event spurred a notable increase in tourism to Barbados, with approximately 78.5% of the increase in tourist arrivals attributable to the World Cup. The economic impact extended beyond the Caribbean, with the India vs. Pakistan match alone projected to generate over $78 million for the New York metropolitan region. This financial windfall underscores the immense commercial potential of cricket in new markets and the power of the sport to drive economic growth. The Playground to Podium initiative in the USA further exemplifies the long-term vision of fostering cricket at the grassroots level, aiming to engage one million school children by the 2028 Los Angeles Olympics.\n",

       "**III. Strategic Shifts and Emerging Talent**\n",
       "\n",
       "The 2024 T20 World Cup also influenced T20 strategies and highlighted emerging talent. Bowlers like Fazalhaq Farooqi and Arshdeep Singh set new records for wickets taken in a single edition, demonstrating the increasing importance of bowling prowess in the T20 format. The pitches in the USA, often favoring bowlers, sparked discussions about adapting strategies to varying conditions. The tournament also saw the rise of new stars, potentially impacting team dynamics and player valuations in domestic T20 leagues worldwide. The focus on data analytics and adaptability became more pronounced, signaling a continuous evolution in coaching and training methodologies within the sport."

       "**I. Tournament Triumph and Key Performances**\n",
       "\n",
       "The 2024 T20 World Cup culminated in a thrilling final where India defeated South Africa by 7 runs, showcasing the high stakes and competitive spirit that defined the tournament. India's victory was underpinned by stellar performances, including leading run-scorer Virat Kohli. Several matches stood out, including the USA tying with Pakistan and winning in the super over, and Afghanistan's stunning 21-run victory over Australia, highlighting the growing competitiveness of emerging cricket nations. These upsets, combined with nail-biting finishes, underscored the unpredictable nature of T20 cricket and captivated audiences worldwide.\n",
       "\n",
       "**II. Global Reach and Economic Impact**\n",
       "\n",
       "The tournament's co-hosting by the West Indies and the United States marked a significant step in cricket's global expansion. The event spurred a notable increase in tourism to Barbados, with approximately 78.5% of the increase in tourist arrivals attributable to the World Cup. The economic impact extended beyond the Caribbean, with the India vs. Pakistan match alone projected to generate over $78 million for the New York metropolitan region. This financial windfall underscores the immense commercial potential of cricket in new markets and the power of the sport to drive economic growth. The Playground to Podium initiative in the USA further exemplifies the long-term vision of fostering cricket at the grassroots level, aiming to engage one million school children by the 2028 Los Angeles Olympics.\n",

       "**III. Strategic Shifts and Emerging Talent**\n",
       "\n",
       "The 2024 T20 World Cup also influenced T20 strategies and highlighted emerging talent. Bowlers like Fazalhaq Farooqi and Arshdeep Singh set new records for wickets taken in a single edition, demonstrating the increasing importance of bowling prowess in the T20 format. The pitches in the USA, often favoring bowlers, sparked discussions about adapting strategies to varying conditions. The tournament also saw the rise of new stars, potentially impacting team dynamics and player valuations in domestic T20 leagues worldwide. The focus on data analytics and adaptability became more pronounced, signaling a continuous evolution in coaching and training methodologies within the sport."
